# Trail Maps 
This project is mostly an excuse to learn react, sass, node and webpack. However, what Im utimately try to do is create a site for outdoor enthusiasts like myself to search for, plan, and recount our outdoor adventures. I want to make a site that uses Maps (both Google and Scanned trail maps). 

Will update with more details later...
